# Facial Exercises
> Our app guides you through a variety of facial exercises aimed to improve mobility.

[![Swift Version][swift-image]][swift-url]

Facial exercises began as a two day hackathon project. It was intended to mimick post-stroke exercises. Using ARKit the app tracks movement of specific facial features, graphing range of motion trends for each exercise. During an individual exercise, real time feedback is displayed describing the relative movement of the specific feature. After the completion of all exercises selected, users are shown their highest score for each. The scores range from 0.0 (neutral) to 1.0 (maximum movement). These scores are saved to CoreData and plotted on individual line graphs representing movement trends for each exercise, to help visualize how much movement has been regained.
